# Project title:
Addressing the Lusophone technological wishlist proposals

## Brief summary:
The Lusophone technological wishlist, in the Lusophone Wiki context, is a survey that intends to understand which technological innovations tools, and platforms could be modified to improve user experience, that is, to identify and prioritize the most basic needs of the community of editors, readers, and researchers of the Wikimedia projects in Portuguese, so they have a more productive and pleasant experience.

The list's creation is related to recommendations 2 and 9 of the Wikimedia Movement Strategy 2030, respectively, to Improve User Experience and Innovate in Free Knowledge. The list's objective is to integrate the Portuguese-speaking communities in a strategic and collaborative process that acts towards research and identification of technological bottlenecks in the lusophone projects that prevent or hinder the entry and permanence of new and veteran editors, readers, and researchers of the Wikimedia projects in Portuguese.

After the voting of the proposals by the community, we published the compiled list of the most desired technological wishes and are now proposing a new Outreachy project, focused on resolving one or more wishes of the published list. That mostly means developing scripts and editing templates on Wiki, with a track for developing web applications. We do not intend to tackle everything.

# Project timeline:
This project timeline outlines my planned work and tasks for the 13-week Addressing the Lusophone Technological Wishlist Proposals Outreachy internship from December to March. I have broken down the timeline into detailed weekly deliverables totaling 40 hours per week. The tasks encompass onboarding, core feature development, testing, documentation, bug fixes, and knowledge transfer. Please refer to the table below for the full timeline. I am excited to contribute to the Addressing the Lusophone technological wishlist proposals project through this internship opportunity!

## summary of Project Timeline.
Based on the provided list at [Wishlist proposals]([url](https://meta-wikimedia-org.translate.goog/wiki/Lista_de_desejos_tecnol%C3%B3gicos_da_lusofonia/Propostas?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp)), Here is a summary of the outline for the first five tasks:

**Task 1: TOOL THAT LISTS PAGES WITH BROKEN LINKS**
- Research existing scripts like Dead Link Finder and analyze their functionality.
- Develop a script/tool that can check broken links in a set of pages on Portuguese Wikipedia, grouped by a hidden category.
- Implement functionality to encourage wikicontest participants to correct broken links.
- Test the tool for accuracy and efficiency.
- Document the development process and provide instructions for users.
- Seek feedback from the Wikimedia community and iterate on the tool accordingly.

**Task 2: ACTIVATE INTERNETARCHIVEBOT ON PORTUGUESE WIKIPEDIA**
- Investigate the compatibility issues between Wikipedia templates/modules and pt:User:InternetArchiveBot.
- Analyze the source of the problems and identify possible solutions.
- Modify the bot to address the compatibility issues.
- Test the bot with different scenarios to ensure proper functionality.
- Collaborate with the Portuguese Wikipedia community to gather feedback and address any concerns.
- Document the changes made and provide instructions for future maintenance.

**Task 3: ADAPTATION TO FEMININE OR NEUTRAL GENDER IN TEMPLATES AND PROJECT PAGES**
- Identify templates and project pages that use masculine gender as neutral.
- Propose changes to the templates to include options in the feminine or neutral gender.
- Implement the necessary modifications to the templates and project pages.
- Test the modified templates to ensure they function correctly with the new options.
- Collaborate with the Wikimedia community to gather feedback and address any concerns or suggestions.
- Document the changes made and provide guidelines for maintaining inclusive language in templates and project pages.

**Task 4: IMPROVEMENT OF THE SEMI-AUTOMATIC TRANSLATION TOOL, ESPECIALLY INFOBOXES**
- Conduct a thorough analysis of the existing semi-automatic translation tool and its limitations.
- Identify specific issues related to the translation of infoboxes and automatic content filters.
- Collaborate with the community to gather feedback on the tool's shortcomings and desired improvements.
- Work on enhancing the translation tool, with a focus on addressing infobox translation challenges.
- Test the updated tool, ensuring improved functionality and usability.
- Communicate the changes to the community, encouraging further feedback and suggestions for enhancement.
- Document the improvements made to the tool and provide guidelines for its effective usage.

**Task 5: IMPROVEMENT OF THE "ADD SUGGESTED IMAGE" TOOL**
- Analyze the current "Add Suggested Image" tool and its limitations.
- Identify ways to enhance the tool to allow for the automatic addition of images to infoboxes.
- Develop modifications to the tool to enable seamless image insertion in infoboxes.
- Test the updated tool, ensuring it functions as intended and integrates well with infoboxes.
- Collect feedback from users, especially newbies, to evaluate the effectiveness of the improvement.
- Document the changes made and provide instructions for using the enhanced tool.

Each task should include time for research, development, testing, collaboration with the community, documentation, and iterations based on feedback. The timeline and allocation of hours for each task can be adjusted based on the complexity and priority of the solutions.
